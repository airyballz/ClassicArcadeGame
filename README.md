A Udacity FEND project.

This is an implementation of Frogger game where user has to go through a lane avoiding the beetles.
They score a point once they cross the lanes without getting hit and land on the life raft.
They also get points by collecting random gems in the lanes.

After that, use the arrow keys to move the character.
Your goal is to make reach the raft (on the top) without getting hit from any of the beetles.
When the player reaches the raft side, he starts again from the default position but with the score incremented.
